Key Capabilities:

- SBOM analysis
- Package and OS vulnerability detection
- Exploit detection
- Leaked secret detection
- Malware detection
- Misconfiguration detection
- Rootkit detection

### [APIClarity](https://github.com/openclarity/apiclarity)

APIClarity is an open source tool for APIs that helps you visualize and identify potential risks around API usage in your cloud native environments. It helps build the OpenAPI specifications for all APIs in your environment, then helps track drift, shadow or zombie usage for those APIs. You can then use this information to build your application security posture.
