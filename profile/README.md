Key Capabilities:

- SBOM analysis
- Package and OS vulnerability detection
- Exploit detection
- Leaked secret detection
- Malware detection
- Misconfiguration detection
- Rootkit detection

## Kubernetes Security

[KubeClarity](https://github.com/openclarity/kubeclarity) is a tool for detection and management of software bills of materials (SBOMs) and vulnerabilities in container images and filesystems. It scans both runtime Kubernetes clusters and CI/CD pipelines for enhanced software supply-chain security.

Key Capabilities:

- SBOM and vulnerability detection
- Comprehensive dashboard for SBOM analysis
- Pluggable architecture

## API Security

[APIClarity](https://github.com/openclarity/apiclarity) is a tool that helps you visualize and identify potential risks around API usage in your cloud native environments. It helps build the OpenAPI specifications for all APIs in your environment, then helps track drift, shadow or zombie usage for those APIs. You can then use this information to build your application security posture.
